                Sapkal was born on November 14, 1948, to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder, in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district in the Central Provinces and Berar of British India. She was named Chindhi since she was an unwanted child (Marathi for "torn piece of cloth").
                After passing the fourth grade, she was forced to drop out of school due to extreme poverty, family responsibilities, and an early marriage. Sapkal married Shrihari Sapkal, a 20-year-old man, when she was 12 years old and went to Nawargaon
                village in Wardha. The marriage did not last long, and she was left to care for a girl child at the age of 20.

                Sapkal devoted herself to orphans. As a result, she was fondly called "Mai", which means "mother". She nurtured over 1,500 orphaned children and through them had a grand family of 382 sons-in-law and 49 daughters-in-law. She has been honoured with more
                than 700 awards for her work. She used award money to buy land to make a home for orphaned children.
